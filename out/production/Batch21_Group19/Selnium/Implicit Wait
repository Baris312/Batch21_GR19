- Implicit wait:
        - Implicit wait is one of the Selenium wait types.
        - It comes from Selenium library.
        - It is triggered everytime we use .findElement/s() method
        - If .findElement() method is not able to find a webElement SECONDS given in implicitlyWait method will be used as extra wait time.

      EX;   driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
           ->If findElement cannot find for any reason, it will have UPTO extra 15 seconds to wait before throwing NoSuchElementException

        - Our driver will wait UP TO given seconds, and move immediately after locating a web element.
        - If driver is not able to locate a web element in the given duration, it will throw NoSuchElementException.
        - By default implicitlyWait value is 0 seconds.



        ******* Implicit Wait                    VS            Thread.sleep();
1 - implicit wait will apply to every time we use               1 - Not selenium wait.
2 - It does not have to wait for the WHOLE duration.            2 - It will wait for the given duration no matter what
 ->It will wait until the condition happens.                         ->It does not look for any condition.
3- If findElement method can find the                           3- So if we say, Thread.sleep(5000); it will stop the execution of the code.
 webElement it will keep continuing.
