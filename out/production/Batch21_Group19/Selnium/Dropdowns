HANDLING DROPDOWNS WITH SELENIUM
    - There are two types of dropdowns.


    WHAT CAN BE TESTED ABOUT A DROPDOWN?
        - What is selected by default?
        - What options are available in the dropdowns?
        - When you select an option, is it actually selected?



   **** Q*  How many type of dropdown there are ?

    #1- HTML Dropdowns:
        -> If it is an HTML dropdown, meaning it is not <select> tag, we just locate it as any other web element, and click to it.
    #2- Select Dropdowns:
        -> Select dropdowns are created using <select> tag.

Q*  What is Select class in Selenium Library:
               - Basically a class that has bunch of ready methods to handle <select> type of dropdown.
           When can we use the Select class?
               - Only if the dropdown has <select> tag.



     *********** How to handle Select dropdowns using selenium?
        #1- We need to locate the <select> dropdown
        #2- We need to create object of Select class (from selenium library)
        #3- Pass the web element into Select constructor.
        #4- We will be allowed to use select dropdown methods.


   **** Select select = new Select(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//select[@id='dropdown']")));


*******How do we actually select from a SELECT dropdown?
 - There are 3 ways of selecting.
    -> selectByVisibleText()
        -* this method accepts a string argument
        -* then selects the given option with visible text
            ---> syntax: select.byVisibleText("text goes here");

    -> selectByValue
        -* this method will select by the value of the attribute "value"
            --> syntax: select.byValue("1");
    -> selectByIndex
        -* this one selects by the index number of the <option>
        -* index start from 0
            --->syntax: select.byIndex(2);



How do we get what is selected from the dropdown?
    - getFirstSelectedOption();
    - This method will get the option that is currently selected.
    - This method will return the currently selected option as a web element




How do we get all of the options in a dropdown?
    -> .getOptions();
        - This method just returns all of the existing options in the dropdown.
        - Return type: List<WebElement>

    -> .getAllSelectedOptions();
        - This method will return all of the selected options.

    -> .deDeselectAll();
        - IF there are multiple options selected, it will de-selected whatever is selected.
