Q*  Which locator uses contains keyword for their regular expression
- Xpath

Q* why className locator is not recommended to use
 - className can not have space if there is space we can not use it . error will occur "Compound class name not permitted"


Q* What is difference between relative and absolute Xpath ?
 - main difference  'Relative' doesnt depend on parent notes



 -       Absolute Xpath                           VS                       Relative Xpath
   (Absolute path from parent to child)                                 ('Relative' doesnt depend on parent notes)
    1 - Starts with single slash "/"                                1 - Relative xpath starts with double slash "//"
    2 - Starts from the very root element from  HTML page           2 - "//" --> means you can start from anywhere in the code
    3 - Goes down to desired web element 1 by 1                     3 - start anywhere we want to start from, RELATIVE XPATH is very dependable.
    4 - It is usually very long                                     4 - You will only have problem with this only ->
    and for this reason it is easy to breakable                             if the attribute value you used in the locator is changing.


***** From parent to child  //tagName[@attribute='value']/following-sibling:: attribute

Q* Using Xpath can you traverse back from child to parent to identified parent ?
- Yes we can  .=> .//*[@attribute='value']/parent::className
- CSS you can not do that , its only possible on XPATH !

Q* in scenario  if there is there is no attributes available  is there any way to locate element ?
- yes using text() and empty space both side of  value  ->   //*[text()=' value ']
