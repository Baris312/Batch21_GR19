   **** What is String ?

   - String is any word , character or sentence between double quotation .

 * What is immutable means ?
- object whose contents  can not be  change .
- immutable object created from immutable classes

* Where is String memory locating ?
- String are in Heap memory and in the heap there is String pool ,
     Unless we create new object all the old values saved  and used from  the String pool .
     new Keyword new memory and new object will be create but we are still using String pool memory indirectly from new object

            * Why String is Immutable?

- ones object has created it can not change in heap memory ,
         it can only create new value or new copy in heap as reference of same variable.

 - old memory only remove from java heap memory by java Garbage collector.

 - because String is immutable we dont need to use "new" keyword to create new memory .
     When  we use "new" keyword it allow us to create separate object that reference a separate new value.
     By using "new" keyword we are creating new object in heap memory and not using old attribute value.
     we can use same value in heap memory for different variables when we assign same value to more than 1 variables
     value of object will not be modified or change
      but creating with "new" keyword even same variable and same attribute is not assign to same value because new object has new value.

- So when we are working with String we do not needed "new" keyword because the original String will not be modified
        Because String is immutable .

- If String wasnt immutable when we assign 2 or more variables to some value ,
     and later on when we modified one of assigned variables to change or assign different value than all other variables
     had same value before they will be changing to new value so they can not carry-on old value , So thats why string should be immutable .

- So String is immutable because it will reduce complication and  increase the performance .



 * is there anyway to modify or mutation of String ?

 - Yes , we are using String buffer or String builders to modify value of string .


         ******* String Buffer              VS          String Builder ********
   1- Synchronized (thread-safe)                        1-  NON synchronized (not thread-safe)
   2- Synchronized method to control access             2-  Does not have synchronized methods
    (only one thread can access to StringBuffered
    object's synchronized code at one time )
    
    3- Slower than String builder                       3- Faster
