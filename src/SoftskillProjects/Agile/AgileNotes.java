Vytrack Company -> A fleet management company that develops software for use by other fleet management companies.Projects
We work in the IT department of this company and our project is to create and test Fleet management software, that meets the customer requirements.
I am a tester in this company. We applied Agile methodology, because Agile focusses on the customer and brings customer satisfaction and also because it moves quickly and easily and encourages teamwork. WE have 11 members in our team: We have 1 PO, 1 BA, 1 SM, 5 Devs, 3 Testers.How we implement Agile Scrum in our project?
The PO and BA gather user stories from the clients and prioritize them in the product backlog in Jira.
After we conduct Grooming meeting to assign points to the user stories. We use the Fibonacci system to assign the stories.
Sprint Planning meeting
We use 2 weeks sprint for our project, and it is the SM who starts and eds the sprint. The sprint planning meeting takes place on the first day of sprint, and we decide how much points we can finish in the sprint. We also move user stories form the product backlog to the sprint backlog.
We hold daily stand - up meetings throughout the sprints and at this meeting, which is held every morning and last 15 minutes, we update the team members about the progress of our work. Like: what I did yesterday, what I would do today and if I have any blockers or impediments.
We conduct Demo meeting on the last day of the sprint. And this meeting is attended by the client and every member of the scrum team, here the developers and testers demonstrates the software that was produced during the sprint.
The Scrum master and the Dev team conduct a Retro meeting to discuss what went well and what went wrong as well as what we can improve. This meeting is held on the last day of the sprint.
