software testing life cycle




stlc is series of systematic and well defined steps performed during the testing of a software application

what  is benefits ;
 testing team gets  involved right from initial phases of software development life cycle


 lower cost ad time to deliver more efficient  product to achive our goal in each every sprint  time


 Req Analysys  get details , review and understand all the requirement documents

 test planing prepareation ; most important activity on stlc
 > defining test specification  > Resource allocations  to estimate duration and cost anlysy , Which included tolls and training costs

Test case creation > we are specifying test cases and define if they will be test manually or automated
 and defines which tools will be use to test .We aso creating test cases   and test data

Test case environment ; we are setting envirmont and tolls and all smiliotions need to start testing .
 if test needs software or hardware like smoke est and  need parallel test  or development stage test
 like unit testing and server for continue integration testing .
 As of test team we may not involve all test stage like non functional test such as stress and perform testing
  but environment and all testing tool get to set up for all team and traning has to be done in this stage so we can go to next stage of

test executions ; So when we ae ready we start our test to manual and auotomated test . During execution any default or bug found manage by our management tools like  jira to adress to dev and q&a depertment for validation , fix and retest . Tracking all test plan and defects or  bugreport  .


Test Cycle closer ;

so we are discussing time , test covarege , software +,-,
quality and quantity reports  bug report analysis for bug type of severity.
 with all of this informations we are creation test closure report and preparation for next step of deployment .
