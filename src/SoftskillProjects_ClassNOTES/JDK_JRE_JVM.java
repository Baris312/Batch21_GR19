                ****** JDK

     *  Java Development Kit
     -  Development kit help you to create java program
     -  Basically tool that  code you wrote convert it to  a format that java runtime and jvm can execute.
     -  any kind of code , debugging ,testing or finding error also java compiler to compiles  code
     - java Development kit comes with JRE and JVM as package

    *  JRE - Java Run time Environment
    -  its basically runs java programs
    - It has java development tools, libraries , java launcher and other files that JVM uses to  execute
    



    * JVM
    - java virtual machine
     - it doesnt have development tools it loads code , verifies and execute  code
    - java virtual machine knows nothing about the java programing language all it knows that it can do work with complied
 java codes. So its like a machine that in our  computer when we execute program from java run time environment
 it runs this virtual machine so code get executed.
 So jdk  create and takes java codes to as class files to executing in java virtual machine


 C++  compile code straight into its own  hardware  that's how C++  execute code faster than Java programme ..
 Basically java gets code and runs in java virtual machine  its like two step work instead of 1 action like C++.
