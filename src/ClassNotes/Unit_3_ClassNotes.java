        day29_Methods

 method: MUST be within class
 AccessModifier  specifier   returnTYPE   MethodName (Parameter){   statements   }

 AccessModifier: public, protected, default, private
 public: open to the all class and package

 specifier: static, final, abstract, synchronized

 static: can be called through the class name
 void: method does not return any dataparameter:

------------------------------------------------------------

   without parameter: if all info are known for completing the functionality
   with parameter: additional information that's must needed for the method to complete the functionality
   if method passes parameter, we MUST give argument to the method when we call it

----------------------------------------------------------------

Retrun Method :   MUST return a matching data makes the data of the method to be reusable

----------------------------------------------------------------
Method Overloading: multiple methods sharing the same name
Parameters MUST BE DIFFERENT (either data type or number of parameters)
SAME  NAME  DIFFERENT PARAMETERS
return  = does not matter (can be same or different)


----------------------------------------------------------------

WrapperClass ===>
Data Structures:
1. Array: supports both primitives and none primitives
2. Collection: does not support primitives
3. Map: does not support primitives
Wrapper class: Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean
presensted in "java.lang"package.
 Autoboxing: coverting primitives to wrapper class value
 Unboxing: converting wrapper class value to primitives Integer, Double,  Boolean, Character
 methods:
 1. parse methods: converting string to primitives not case sensitive
 2. valueOf methods: converting string to Wrapper class not case sensitive

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
ArrayList ====>
Data Structurs:
1. Array: size is fixed, [], supports primitives & non primitive
2. Collection: size is dynamic, does not support primitives
3. Map: size is dynamic, does not support primitives
ArrayList: part of Collection, is a class, internally uses arraysize is automatically adjusteddoes not support primitives   has index



get():
size():
set():
remove():
clear():
indexOf():
lastIndexOf():
conatins(Object):
equal(list):
isEmpty():
----------------------------------------------------------------



Custom class:
String class:
Attributes:(text, index)
actions:substring(), toUpper(), toLower(), indexOf()....

instance variable: object variables  each object has it's own copy of instance variables
declared outside the methods
instance methods: object methods does not have static
Custom Class:
1. instances
2. statics
3. Constructor

removeAll: if the objects that we wanna remove are already known
retainAll: if the objects that we wanna keep are already known
removeIf: if the objects that we wanna remove are already unknown

----------------------------------------------------------------
Static ===>

instance: belong to the object each object has it's own copy of instances

static: belong to the class, class member -> there is only one copy is shared by the class and all objects of the class
- static variables
-static methods
-static block
-static class
-static ONLY accepts static members
-static variables: belong to the class.
ONLY one copy static methods: belong to the class.
